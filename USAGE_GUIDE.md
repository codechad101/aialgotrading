## 📉 **SHORT SELLING Explained**

### **What is Short Selling?**
- **SELL first, BUY back later** at a lower price
- **Profit from falling prices** 
- Opposite of regular trading (BUY low, SELL high)

### **How It Works:**
1. **📉 AI detects downtrend** (RSI overbought, bearish signals)
2. **🎯 SELL action** generated (enter short position)
3. **💰 Price falls** to take profit level
4. **🔄 Position closed** automatically (buy back at lower price)
5. **💰 Profit = Entry Price - Exit Price**

### **Example Short Trade:**
```
Entry: SELL EURUSD at 1.08450 (expecting fall)
Target: BUY back at 1.08000 (450 pips lower)
Profit: (1.08450 - 1.08000) = $450 profit per lot
```

### **Risk Management:**
- **Stop Loss above entry** (if price rises unexpectedly)
- **Take Profit below entry** (when price falls as expected)
- **Same position sizing** as long trades
- **Daily loss limits** still apply

### **When AI Uses Short Selling:**
- 📊 **Technical indicators** show bearish signals
- 📈 **RSI overbought** (>70) indicating reversal
- 📉 **MACD bearish crossover**
- 🔻 **Price below key moving averages**
- 📊 **Resistance level rejections**

The system **automatically decides** between LONG (BUY) and SHORT (SELL) based on market conditions!
